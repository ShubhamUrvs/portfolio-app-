  domain: 'Healthcare | Artificial Intelligence | NLP',
  technologies: ['Python', 'AI/NLP'],
  introduction: 'Healthcare emergencies often require immediate guidance before professional medical help arrives. However, access to doctors or medical experts may not always be instant, especially in remote areas or during peak emergencies. CareAssist AI is designed to bridge this gap by providing real-time first-aid and medication guidance using artificial intelligence and natural language processing.',
  problemStatement: [
    'Delay in medical response during emergencies',
    'Over-dependence on human availability',
    'Lack of instant medical guidance in rural or low-resource areas',
    'Inability of users to interpret medical instructions from static sources',
  ],
  objectives: [
    'Provide instant first-aid guidance using AI',
    'Reduce emergency response time',
    'Assist users before professional medical help arrives',
    'Use NLP to understand natural human language',
    'Improve healthcare accessibility using technology',
  ],
  systemOverview: 'CareAssist AI operates as a conversational healthcare assistant. The user interacts with the chatbot via text input. The system analyzes symptoms using NLP techniques, matches them with predefined medical knowledge, and generates appropriate responses.',
